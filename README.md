📘 Hedonic Scales and ANOVA in Sensory Evaluation
This repository contains the source code and explanation for a tutorial on the use of hedonic scales in sensory evaluation, with a focus on the application of Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) under different experimental designs.

The examples are written in R using the tidyverse, agricolae, and nlme packages. The document is part of a larger book project focused on sensory analysis using R.

Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) with post-hoc comparison using agricolae

Repeated Measures ANOVA using both aov() and lme()

Interpretation of ANOVA outputs and when post-hoc tests are needed

Visualizations with ggplot2

Best practices: converting variables to factors and understanding model structure
